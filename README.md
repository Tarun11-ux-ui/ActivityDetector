“Today, classrooms have changed — students are distracted, teachers are overwhelmed, and engagement is dropping. But what if a simple camera could understand what’s happening in the classroom in real-time?
We built the AI Smart Classroom Analyzer, a computer-vision powered system that detects student engagement automatically. Using a webcam and lightweight AI models, it can identify key behaviors like:
Attentive students
Sleeping or head-down students
Hand-raise gestures
Phone usage and distractions
Our system combines YOLO object detection with MediaPipe pose landmarks and a machine-learning model trained on our own dataset to classify behaviors accurately.
Teachers get a live dashboard showing:
Engagement percentage
Count of distracted students
Real-time alerts
A minute-by-minute engagement graph
Session summary reports
This helps teachers spot issues instantly, and schools can use the data to improve learning outcomes.
What makes it special is that it works on a single laptop webcam, requires no hardware, and can be deployed in any school at zero cost.
With AI Smart Classroom Analyzer, we’re building the future of attentive, efficient, and data-driven classrooms.”
